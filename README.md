# Blueprint_DevBoard01
This is my devboard following the tutorial for hackclub's blueprint program and also because I want to go to prototype,
you may be wondering why I made this is because:
1. I need a Rasberry Pi Pico and this is the same thing as one
2. I want to customize it
3. I want to to to Prototype seems fun
4. A tutorial into hardware
5. I'm bored
6. It's easy
7. It also makes you look like your a pro at PCB's
